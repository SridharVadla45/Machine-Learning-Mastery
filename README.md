# 🚀 Machine Learning Mastery

## Mathematics, Intuition, Python, Deep Learning, and Real-World Engineering

**Transform from ZERO → PRO MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEER**

---

## 🎯 Vision & Philosophy

This is not just another ML course. This is a **complete mastery system** designed to:

- **Build deep intuition** - Understand the "why" behind every algorithm
- **Master the mathematics** - From linear algebra to optimization theory
- **Code everything from scratch** - Build neural networks without libraries
- **Ship real products** - Deploy production ML systems
- **Think like an engineer** - Solve real-world problems with ML

### Our Learning Philosophy

1. **First Principles Thinking** - Understand concepts from the ground up
2. **Learn by Building** - Every concept has hands-on implementation
3. **Math + Code Together** - See equations come alive in Python
4. **Progressive Difficulty** - Start simple, build to advanced
5. **Real-World Focus** - Every topic connects to industry applications

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **uv** (modern Python package manager)
- **VS Code** (recommended) or any code editor
- **Git** for version control

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone/navigate to the repository
cd machine-learning-mastery

# Create environment and install dependencies
uv sync

# Test your setup
uv run 00-python-fundamentals/examples.py

# Start learning!
```

### Running Modules

```bash
# Run examples
uv run 01-linear-algebra/examples.py

# Do exercises
uv run 07-supervised-learning/exercises.py

# Check solutions
uv run 07-supervised-learning/solutions.py
```

See `env-setup.md` for detailed installation instructions.
