## 🎯 Study Plan

### Daily Routine (2-3 hours/day)

**Day Structure:**
1. **Theory (30 min)** - Read `theory.md`, understand concepts
2. **Examples (30 min)** - Run `examples.py`, study implementations
3. **Practice (60 min)** - Complete `exercises.py`
4. **Problems (30 min)** - Solve easy → medium → hard problems
5. **Review (15 min)** - Check `solutions.py`, understand mistakes

### Weekly Routine

- **Monday-Thursday**: Learn new modules
- **Friday**: Do medium/hard problems
- **Weekend**: Build mini-projects, review weak areas

### Problem-Solving Approach

- **Easy Problems (10)** - Quick concept checks, warm-up
- **Medium Problems (10)** - Multi-step reasoning, implementations
- **Hard Problems (5)** - Think like an ML engineer, debug, optimize

**When to attempt:**
- ✅ **Easy**: After reading theory and examples
- ✅ **Medium**: After completing exercises
- ✅ **Hard**: After mastering medium problems
